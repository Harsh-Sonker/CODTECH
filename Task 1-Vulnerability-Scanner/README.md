# CODTECH Internship Task

This repository contains my solution for the internship task assigned by CODTECH. The task involves developing a basic vulnerability scanner tool in Python. This tool is designed to scan a target network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and basic misconfigurations.

## Overview

The vulnerability scanner performs the following tasks:

- **Port Scanning**: Uses `nmap` to identify open ports on the specified target.
- **Software Version Check**: Checks the version of Apache HTTP Server against a predefined latest version to determine if an update is needed.
- **Misconfiguration Check**: Includes a basic placeholder for checking common misconfigurations.

## Project Structure

- `Vulnerability_Scanner.py`: Python script containing the main vulnerability scanning logic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and usage instructions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `nmap` Python library (`python-nmap`)
- `requests` library
- `BeautifulSoup` library for web scraping

## Installation and Usage

To use the vulnerability scanner:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harsh-Sonker/CODTECH.git
   cd codtech-internship-task
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install python-nmap requests beautifulsoup4
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Vulnerability_Scanner.py
4. Follow the prompts to enter the target IP address or hostname, and review the scanner's findings.
